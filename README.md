# YelpCamp
My YelpCamp project

This is a Node.js based project consisting of a web application through which we can add and remove various campgrounds/locations of our choice to the app.
-This is the very first version of it and will improve continuously with time.
-Many features like location, likes, ratings etc. will be added as soon as possible.
